**Task: Below are the steps:**



*   Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
*   Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.

*   Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses
